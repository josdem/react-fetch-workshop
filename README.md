## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run format`

Formats all the project's files using Prettier, a code formatter.
Prettier adheres to the configuration specified in the `.prettierrc` file.
You can exclude certain files from formatting using the `.prettierignore` file.

### `npm run test`

Runs all tests in interactive format.
